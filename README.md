# Community Fridge Tracker - Project Summary

## Mission: Help communities stay connected with their local mutual aid fridges through real-time updates and AI-powered insights.

## The Problem: Community members don't know what's needed in their local fridges, leading to oversupply of some items while critical needs (like feminine hygiene products) go unmet. Fridge maintainers lack visibility into usage patterns and repair needs.

## The Solution: A web app that crowdsources fridge updates and uses AI to generate actionable bulletins, making it easy for anyone to contribute meaningfully to their community's food security.

## Core Features:

### Smart Bulletin Board: AI summarizes the last 7 days into digestible insights ("Fridge is fixed!", "Need: tampons - none dropped this week")

### Simple Update System: Users post categorized updates (stock drops, repairs) through an intuitive form

### Universal Access: Anonymous browsing for checking stock, magic link auth for contributing
Multi-Location Support: Scale across neighborhoods and cities

## Target Users:

Contributors like Jane (checks before Costco runs) and Eleanor (fridge maintainer)
Community Members like Franny (food-insecure families checking for essentials)

## Tech Stack: 
React + TypeScript, Supabase backend, AI-powered summaries, progressive web app for mobile accessibility

## Impact Goal: Reduce food waste and gaps in community mutual aid through better coordination and communication.
